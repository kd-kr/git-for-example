Oculus Rift S is a virtual reality headset co-developed by Lenovo Technologies and Oculus—a brand of Facebook Technologies .

Announced in March 2019 and released that May, it is a successor to the original Oculus Rift CV1 model, 
with noted changes including a new "inside-out" positional tracking system with cameras embedded inside the headset unit (similarly to its sister device, the Oculus Quest), 
a higher-resolution display, and a new "halo" head strap.

The Rift S received mixed reviews, with critics praising improvements in comfort and 
ease of setup due to the halo strap and new tracking system, but characterizing the Rift S as being only an incremental upgrade over the CV1, 
and noting regressions such as a lower refresh rate, and the lack of hardware adjustment for inter pupillary distance (IPD).

and then he lives alive his life.
